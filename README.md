# Machine Learning Project - Retail Sales Forecasting - Walmart

## 1. Introduction

This report details a machine learning project aimed at forecasting weekly sales for a retail store with multiple outlets across the country. The project utilizes the "Walmart DataSet.csv" dataset, which contains weekly sales data along with various influencing factors such as unemployment rate, temperature, fuel price, and consumer price index. The primary goal is to provide insights into sales patterns and develop a predictive model for future sales forecasting.

## 2. Objectives

The primary objectives of this project were:

* To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between various factors and weekly sales.
* To identify and handle outliers and missing values in the dataset.
* To develop and evaluate predictive models for forecasting weekly sales for the next 12 weeks.
* To answer specific business questions related to the impact of unemployment rate, seasonality, temperature, and consumer price index on weekly sales.

## 3. Methodology

The project followed a structured approach:

1.  **Data Exploration:**
    * Imported necessary Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels).
    * Loaded the "Walmart DataSet.csv" dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
    * Performed initial data inspection, including checking data types and unique values.
    * Converted the Date column to datetime format, and extracted weekday, month and year values.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * Analyzed the distribution of the target variable (Weekly_Sales).
    * Visualized the distribution of numerical features and identified outliers.
    * Examined the relationships between features using pair plots.
3.  **Data Preprocessing:**
    * Removed duplicate rows.
    * Checked for and handled missing values (none found).
    * Converted categorical features to numerical using one-hot and dummy encoding.
    * Removed outliers using the interquartile range (IQR) method.
4.  **Feature Engineering and Selection:**
    * Extracted time based features.
5.  **Predictive Modeling:**
    * Implementation of various regression models to predict weekly sales.
    * Future steps, not completed in provided code, would include model evaluation and selection.
6.  **Business Insights:**
    * Analysis of the impact of unemployment rate, seasonality, temperature, and consumer price index on weekly sales.
    * Identification of top and worst performing stores.
    * Forecasting sales for the next 12 weeks.

## 4. Dataset Description

The "Walmart DataSet.csv" dataset contains the following columns:

* **Store:** Store number.
* **Date:** Week of sales.
* **Weekly_Sales:** Sales for the given store in that week.
* **Holiday_Flag:** If it is a holiday week.
* **Temperature:** Temperature on the day of the sale.
* **Fuel_Price:** Cost of the fuel in the region.
* **CPI:** Consumer Price Index.
* **Unemployment:** Unemployment Rate.

## 5. Results and Observations

* The target variable (Weekly_Sales) was found to be normally distributed.
* Outliers were identified and removed from numerical features.
* The dataset was cleaned and prepared for modeling.
* Time based features were created to help with the seasonality of the data.
* The code provided shows the data preparation and EDA stages, but does not contain the predictive modeling or forecasting section.

## 6. Conclusion

This project successfully loaded, cleaned, and explored the Walmart sales dataset. The EDA provided valuable insights into the relationships between various factors and weekly sales. The data preprocessing steps ensured that the dataset was ready for predictive modeling.

## 7. Future Work

Future steps for this project include:

* Developing and evaluating predictive models for forecasting weekly sales.
* Using time series models to forecast sales.
* Performing feature selection to improve model performance.
* Providing detailed answers to the business questions related to the impact of various factors on sales.
* Forecasting sales for the next 12 weeks and providing actionable insights to the retail store.
* Evaluating the models using time series evaluation metrics.
* Testing different models, and comparing the results.
* Refining the outlier detection method.
